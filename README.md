## About

An automation framework and robot program for NXT-lejOS.

### **piaf** - piaf is an automation framework

A small framework that contains means to create sporadic and cyclic task and petri-nets in an object oriented way.
I've got also some ideas to use PNML to create net-(structure)s...

More to come...

### **robot** - the C3LegO - cleaning robot

The sample application to demonstrate the power of piaf. A (Lego) cleaning robot inspired by iRobots Roomba(R).

## Why LejOS and Java

Trying to use Ada at first I stuggled with compiler issues, and finally found out that there is (currently) no way to store a program on the flash, I was looking for another (object oriented) way to program the NXT brick.
Not being my favorite language for real-time programing, the lejOS platform is comperable mature and really easy to use.
That's why it's Java...
