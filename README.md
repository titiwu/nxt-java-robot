## Why LejOS and Java

Trying to use Ada at first I stuggled with compiler issues, and finally found out that there is (currently) no way to store a program on the flash, I was looking for another (object oriented) way to program the NXT brick.
Not being my favorite language for real-time programing, the lejOS platform is comperable mature and really easy to use.
That's why it's Java...
